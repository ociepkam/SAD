# SAD - Scene Analogies with distractions

This task consisted of 36 pairs of scenes selected from the problems originally developed by Chuderska and Chuderski (2014). 

Half of the problems included cross-mapping: an object perceptually similar to the flagged object in the source scene was also present in the second scene but played a different relational role. 

There were four sets of problems: 
    
    (a) six with cross-mapping, 
    (b) the same six with the order of scenes reversed and with cross-mapping eliminated, 
    (c) another twelve problems with cross-mapping, and 
    (d) twelve problems without cross-mapping which were different than the problems in set c. 

Sets a and b were introduced to check whether the cross-mapping effect would occur for problems with the same content (i.e., to make sure that the cross-mapping can be attributed to the pattern of the relation arguments in the univocal way, and not to some other differences between the scenes, such as specific content or presentation details). 

The order of the presentation was the following: 

    6 items randomly chosen from set a and set b (3 items from each set, all six pairs different), 
    24 items from sets c and d in fully random order, 
    6 remaining items from sets a and b. The response options structure in the 18 problems with cross-mapping fully matched that for the 18 problems without cross-mapping, in terms of the options being either animate or inanimate as well as playing or not a role in the relation. The task was preceded by two training problems with feedback (one without and one with cross-mapping). The maximum time for response was 30 seconds per problem. Fig. 2 presents two examples of Scene Analogies (one from set a and the other from set b).
